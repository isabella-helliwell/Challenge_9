# Surf's Up
## 1. Project
    The aim of the project is to analyse some temperature date for June and December month in Oahu.
    First part is to create a summary statistics for June
    Second part is to create a summary statistics for December
    
## 2. Resources
    Data sources: hawaii.sqlite
    Software: Python 3.7.6
    web application: Jupyter Notebook
    
## 3. Analysis
### 3.1 Summary Statistics Temperature- June Data
        An overview of temperatures(tobs) for June month is shown in Output 1. The analysis were carried out for years 2010 to 2017.

## 4. Additiona Analysis
        Additional weather analysis can be beneficial for the visualization of weather trends. One could look into each year, or in this case
        an overview of the precipitation for June  and December is analyzed for the same timeline as the temperature analysis carried out in section 3.
        The analysis were carried out for years 2010-2017.


### 4.1 Summary Statistics precipitation-June 
        An overview of the precipitation is shown in Output 7

  ## 5. Results      
       
        As shown in outputs 1-6, the analysis has been made using weather information data. 
        Comparing the min/max and average temperature for June and December,one can draw the conclusion that June is the 
        hotter month of the two.
        However, we can also see from the histograms that there are more data present for the June (1700 counts) than December (1517 counts)
        Looking at the precipitation data, (outputs 7-10), we can see that the precipitation is on average bigger for December month than June.
        In addition, the maximum precipitation is 6.42 inches for December while it is 4.43 inches for June.
        There are also 1405 count of data for December, while there are more data count, 1574 for June.
        Looking at the analysis of the weather data, the temperatures and rainfall seem to suggest that the weather would be appropiate for opening up a 
        surf and ice cream shop.
